# Othmane AIT EL CADI's dotfiles
This repository contains all the configuration files and folders that I use on my Linux work machine
for different tasks (Wakanda building scripts, git config files, etc...) and programs (Emacs, offline mail
fetching/syncing, etc...)

Everyone is welcomed to use my configuration files partially, entirely or inspect them for looking for inspiration
to build their own environment's configuration.

## Installation

**Warning:** The configuration files present in this repository are **specific** to my Linux environment and
