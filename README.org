** What are dotfiles?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: what-are-dotfiles
   :END:

In the Linux world, dotfiles are a collection of directories,
configuration files and custom scripts that are used to customize the
user experience and tweak the system's look and behavior.

This repository contains the dotfiles that I use on my personal and work
Linux computers. I tried to make them as portable as possible but in
some cases it's just not possible to work around machine specific
requirements, in that case, manual adaption is required.
